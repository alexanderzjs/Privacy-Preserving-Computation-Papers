2. ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS)
3. USENIX Security Symposium (Security)
4. ISOC Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS)
5. International Cryptology Conference (Crypto)
6. European Cryptology Conference (Eurocrypt)
7. European Symposium on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS)
8. ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security (AsiaCCS)
9. Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS)
8. Theory of Cryptography Conference (TCC)
9. International Conference on the Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security (AsiaCrypt)
10. ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy (CODASPY)
11. International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security (FC)
